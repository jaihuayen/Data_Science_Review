\begin{frame}[fragile]{Applications in NLP}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Natural Language Processing (NLP) is now maturely developed in many tasks. For example, we can classify documents into several caegories for as to search files easily. Moreover, we can generate text by generative AI such as GPT series and ChatGPT.
    \item In general, NLP is used in the following several scenarios:
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{Named-entity recognition}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{Document Classification}
            \item Machine Translation
            \item ChatBot
            \item Text Semantic Analysis
            \item Text Generation
          \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
